[If you just want to know how to install it ! ⬅️](#📦-how-to-install)

> **NOTE :** The Previewer_2D_3D is actually in very early development, and may experiment malfunction or bug, if you want to help us and/or participate on improving this plugin don't hesitate to open a PR 📥

A plugin for [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) writted fully in [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html) that allow you to **PREVIEW** 2D or 3D editor while editing on the other one.

It could be really useful for game that use 3D as physic engine but 2D as rendered engine since ``if you manage by code or a way of your own to update the 2D view while editing the 3D view for exemple this Plugin will show you the modification`` **in real time**
